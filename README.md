## Hi

Welcome to WaterCoFire's GitHub homepage. I share some of my interesting projects here. Most of them are assignment projects for some of my modules at DIICSU, and I've got a little bit of confidence in them (at least the grades are high!). So hopefully they can help your work a little bit.

### What I Can Do For You

I'm a very helpful person. If you need a little help with any of the following, I'd be happy to oblige:

- Getting Started with Rubik's Cubes, or CFOP Learning
- IELTS & Academic English (I got Overall Band 8.0 in IELTS & 9.0 in BOTH Listening and Reading!)
- Shanghai travel guide
- Having too much money and always struggling to spend it

#### Plus: If you are a DIICSU Computer Science student

I am more than happy to assist you with any questions you may have about your professional programme. I have on hand many module study notes that I have compiled myself. I have helped many of the Class of 2027 students succeed.
